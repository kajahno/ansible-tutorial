# Terminology

This section will provide with the minimum theory required to work with Ansible.

### Modes of execution

There are two main modes in which Ansible can be run: ad-hoc mode and playbook mode. 

#### Ansible Playbook 

Drawn on a diagram the architecture of Ansible running in playbook-mode would look similar to the following:

##### Inventory

Is where the list of hosts that can be targeted lives.

##### Ansible Playbook file

It's either a `.yml` or `.yaml` file that contains one or more plays.

##### Plays

Can contain one or more tasks, and one or more roles.

##### Roles

Contain a set of tasks with enriched data that can be very useful to be reused, such as templates (for services configuration files, for example)..

##### Tasks

Are the minimum unit of work in Ansible. Ultimately everything is broken down into a task. A task normally includes a module.

##### Module

Units that control certain actions available to be performed by Ansible on the target host. This is where Ansible gets its superpowers from.


#### Ansible ad-hoc

Servers as a way to perform one-off tasks against a group of hosts. Examples: install a apt package on a certain group of hosts.
